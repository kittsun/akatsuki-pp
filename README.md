# akatsuki-pp

This is a rewrite of Akatsuki's current PP system in Rust, based off of [rosu-pp](MaxOhn/rosu-pp). The current system is unbalanced and unpolished, creating discrepancies in plays, maps and other elements of the server. This rework hopes to patch all of the issues that are known in the code, and hopefully create a better experience for players.

## How do I contribute?
You can contribute by making an issue with any suggestions of how to improve the system. If your post is nonsense, spam, or not useful (you don't know what you are talking about), it will be removed, so think 'is this a good thing for discussion' before you post.

## Information
- The Akatsuki server can be found [here](https://akatsuki.pw). It is an osu! private server with Relax and Vanilla functionality.
- This project is being lead by multiple people, mainly the developers of Akatsuki. When this is in a good enough state, it will be moved to the official [Akatsuki](https://github.com/osuAkatsuki) github page.
- If your suggestion / discussion is approved, the issue will be closed. It will stay open until it is implemented.
